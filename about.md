An **Agile** enthusiast with a passion for **Scrum**, **XP**, **Kanban**, **Lean-software**. Actively engaged within the Agile community where I continue to gain insights and knowledge, improving my skills and I continue to stay humble in my approach towards becoming a better servant leader. I try to give something back by providing my thoughts and experiences on my blog and other social platforms. I'm interested in the people side of change and passionate about helping teams and organisations find better ways of working through adopting 'Agile' (as a mindset and in the practical sense of the word).

As a **Scrum Master** at the team level, I focus on coaching teams on self-organisation whereby leadership is treated as an attitude. I encourage teams to strive for continuous improvement and to run small, high-value experiments (even when things are going well).

Supporting **Product Owners** in their role, by enhancing the visualisation of work, technical debt and progress through transparency, increasing the ability to identify maximum product value.

From an **Organisation** perspective, I help support management with their strategic initiatives whilst promoting Scrum on wider scale. Demostrating how Scrum is designed to optimise flexibility, creativity, and productivity.
