An Agile enthusiast with a particular interest in Scrum and other practices such as XP, Kanban and Lean-software.

As a Scrum Master at the team level, I focus on helping teams to become self-organised whereby leadership is treated as an attitude, and I encourage teams to strive for continuous improvement and to run small, high-value experiments (even when things are going well).

Supporting Product Owners in their role, by enhancing the visualisation of work, technical debt and progress through transparency, increasing the ability to identify maximum product value.

From an Organisation perspective, I help support management with their strategic initiatives whilst promoting agile (as a mindset and in the practical sense of the word) at the wider level. Often showing how the Organisation benefits from having self-organisation amongst small cross-functional teams, which is typically done by demonstrating the successes of the Scrum teams.

Actively engaged within the Agile community whereby I'm able gain insights and knowledge to improve my skills and continue to stay humble in my approach towards becoming a better servant leader. I try to give something back by providing my own thoughts and experiences on my blog and other social platforms. I'm interested in the people side of change and always looking for ways to better understand human behavioural differences.
