<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">By far one of the most difficult challenges that I've found whilst working with agile teams to deliver software, it isn't having to deal with the typical constraints; scope, costs, quality, or even time. Instead, I'd have to say one of most difficult challenges to overcome, often seems to be 'us', the people. More specifically, how we behave and communicate with one another - if behavioural diversity can cause conflict, is 'conflict' all that bad? Does using 'behaviour' and 'personality types' assessments really help us gauge an understanding of ourselves and others? Is human social behaviour straight forward?

## Is 'conflict' all that bad?
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Almost all teams will experience some form of conflict sooner or later, and in some cases, particularly in a scrum team it can even be desirable, so long as the conflicts that occur have a positive outcome. If a team are aware of their team members behavioural differences, and they all use a style that allows them to fully express their opinion without causing others to get stressed or take offence, then there could be some positive outcomes, some of which might include:  
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Concerns being raised sooner rather than later
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Improvement to the quality of how decisions are made
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Create an environment suitable for the free flow of meaning (conversation)
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Broaden the discussions to a wider audience by effectively engaging others
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Enhance team cohesiveness
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Consideration of a broader range of ideas
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Surfacing of assumptions that might not be correct

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Most conflicts that occur in an agile team tend to be resolved with a positive outcome, but there is a chance that conflict has a negative outcome. Some examples of negative outcomes might lead to:
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Lack of engagement with each other
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Hesitation in suggesting new ideas
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Delay in informing others of information
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Dips in productivity
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Increase in stress and anxiety</end>

## Assessing Behaviour & Personality Types
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">There are many models that can be used to identify behaviour and personality types, organisations as well as some agile teams, often utilise these models for recruitment, team member/employee evaluations, and even for further career development purposes. Some of the most commonly used models include:
- **MBTI Myer-Briggs Type Indicator**
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">
MBTI is definitely one of the most popular personality assessments. Created by 'Katherine Briggs' and daughter 'Isabel Myers'. It's based on Carl Jung's idea that people understood the world through: sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking.
- **DISC Assessment**
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">
This one is based on the ideas of 'William Marston' and 'Walter Clarke', it evaluates behaviour. Identifying the traits of: dominance, inducement, submission, and compliance.
- **Holtzman Inkblot Technique**
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">
Assesses the personalities with the use of ink blots, and specific criteria such as: rejection, reaction time, place, and space.
- **PCM Process Communication Model**
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">
Originally developed by NASA, utilised to assess and screen their astronauts. It identifies personal strengths by grouping people into six personality types: harmonisers, thinkers, rebels, imagineers, persisters, or promoters.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">When people participant in a behaviour or personality assessments, in most cases, they will admit that they are intrigued to see their results. What I find interesting is that we use these types of models to help us understand, we often like the 'cause and effect' paradigm way of thinking, after all, we like it when things make sense. But how much do these models really tell us about ourselves, others and human social behaviour in general?

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">"_We are in a far better position to observe instincts in animals or in primitives than in ourselves. This is due to the fact that we have grown accustomed to scrutinising our own actions and to seeking rational explanations for them._" Carl Jung

## It's Not Complicated
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">When entering the realm of understanding human social behaviour, most people would argue that it is a complex subject. If it was complicated, for example: like a watch, if the components of the watch was dismantled, we'd know that the sum total of all those components would be equal to that watch, therefore if the components were to be reassembled correctly, then it would become that same functioning watch that we dismantled in the first place. Instead, human social behaviour doesn't always seem to be that straight forward, and can, at times appear to be totally unpredictable, resembling that of a complex system, a bit like the financial markets, or the rain forest.

## Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road?
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What makes the subject of human social behaviour even more difficult to comprehend, is that it has a lot to do with how we think, for example asking, "_why did the chicken cross the road?_" The amount of different responses to this question demonstrates, that there can be many answers, some of them quite plausible, some even funny?! The answers given tend to be based on the perspective and understanding of the person providing the answer, but is that not how we approach and answer every question we are asked?

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">According to American neuroendocrinologist, and Stanford university professor 'Robert Sapolsky', he explains, that we tend to think categorically and he uses the term 'thinking in buckets', meaning that we get a better understanding of something if we can compare, or reference it to something that we already know. He goes and explains, <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">'_suppose there’s a rooster standing next to you, and there’s a chicken across the street. The rooster gives a sexual gesture that is hot by chicken standards, and she promptly runs over to mate with him (I haven’t a clue if this is how it works, but let’s just suppose). And thus we have a key behavioural biological question-why did the chicken cross the road? And if you’re a psychoneuroendocrinologist, your answer would be “Because circulating estrogen levels in that chicken worked in a certain part of her brain to make her responsive to this male signalling,” and if you’re a bio-engineer, the answer would be “Because the long bone in the leg of the chicken forms a fulcrum for her pelvis (or some such thing), allowing her to move forward rapidly,” and if you’re an evolutionary biologist, you’d say, “Because over the course of millions of years, chickens that responded to such gestures at a time that they were fertile left more copies of their genes, and thus this is now an innate behaviour in chickens,_”. I asked my 3 year old niece why she thought the chicken crossed the road?, she replied '_because the lollypop lady said it was ok_'. It goes to show, that thinking in categories, especially across different scientific disciplines, can result in there being many alternative, acceptable explanations.

## Conclusion
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">I think for any agile team, it is definitely worthwhile spending time in, not only establishing a framework for communication, but also spending time to evaluate and gain insights into the behavioural differences of each of the team members. Accept that the human social behaviour is a complex subject, and there can be times where actions of others may appear to be unexpected, or even out of character. But when team members understand and accept the behavioural differences in themselves, as well as others, then an increase of team performance and communication can be achieved.
