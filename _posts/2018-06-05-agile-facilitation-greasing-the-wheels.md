<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">The ability to effectively facilitate groups of individuals that are all fully engaged for the purpose of making decisions collaboratively, seems to be a fundamental skill for a Scrum Master and is a key element to the success of building any type of functional, high performing Agile team - '_why is facilitation considered to be so important for a Scrum Master?_', '_what are some of the challenges found in facilitating?_', And '_what might help with these challenges?_', are all questions that I'll be exploring in this post.

# Facilitation Isn't Easy
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">No doubt, you've seen great facilitation outside of the world of Agile. If you have ever been in a meeting, workshop, or any kind of gathering where group discussions have been made and you've left at the end thinking purpose of the gathering was achieved and that everyone in the group was heard, and they all seemed to have been engaged in what was being discussed, and perhaps thought to yourself afterwards '_Well, that was easy_'. If so, then there is a good chance that it had a great facilitator. After all, the word _'facil'_ in Spanish translates to '_easy_', deriving from the Latin word '_facilis_'. That's not to say facilitation is easy- it's not. In fact, one of the things I've discovered since being a Scrum Master is that the journey towards becoming a great facilitator- is one of the biggest challenges found in communication and collaboration.

# Collaboration Is Nothing New
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">You'll often hear the word '**collaborate**', being said in software development. But what does '_collaborate_' mean? I think, in the bluntest sense it just means '_work together_'. Which is nothing new of course, since we've been working collectively in groups since the beginning of our existents, and to a large extent our ability to collaborate has contributed towards the success as a species.

'_Only by working together are we able to fully account for the emergence and timing of unique features of Homo sapiens and how humans, evolved through natural processes, resulted in a spectacular anomaly among living species_.' - **Kim Hill**

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">In may seem obvious to have groups of people working together in a team in order to accomplish something that would be otherwise difficult if everyone acted as separate individuals, and it would only make sense for a team to practice as a team to improve in working together. Take sport teams for example, they all typically spend hours of their time practising together to improve how they work as a team. In the British Army (and most likely all armies), small teams of soldiers (sections) practically collaborate constantly, in order to accomplish their objectives. They might use terms such as '_mucking in_', instead of '_collaborating_', and refer to someone as '_jacking_', when they're not collaborating. But essentially, they're working together and typically improving how they work together over time.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Some main reasons that, I think, as to why collaboration is heard and echoed so much in software development today is that, generally speaking- any Agile team that collaborates well, keeps their work transparent. Through effective facilitation they're able to advantage of making effective decisions that are driven by the collective knowledge of the team. This also, allows them to make decisions about their work and their commitment that is based on their abilities. This type of transparency with good communication and effective facilitation helps individuals of the team align collectively to focus on a single point, for example, completing a Sprint goal.

# Good Communication Is Essential
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Collaborating requires good communication amongst a team, having a free flow of meaning in conversations allows for a better understanding of each others perspectives, ideas and opinions. If individuals of a team find it difficult to communicate with one another, then it's very likely that it will impact their agility and effectiveness as a team.

'_Most Conversations Are Simply Monologues Delivered in the Presence of a Witness'_- **Margaret Millar** (perhaps, **Mark Twain**?!)

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Being a facilitator can help with promoting and nurturing a safe environment for communication, which is a must for any type of Agile team. This probably all sounds obvious and straight forward. However, what isn't always obvious, are the types of obstacles (impediments) that prevent communication from working effectively and how facilitation can help, which I'll come back to.

# Scrum Master Facilitation Is Not
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">I've been inspired recently after reading an interesting article by [Tobias Mayer](http://tobiasmayer.uk/), that explores the topic of collaboration. In this article ([Collaboration: the art of letting go](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaboration-art-letting-go-tobias-mayer/)), Tobias explores this topic and doesn't start with an explanation to what he thinks collaboration is- instead, he starts by offering specific examples of what collaboration is NOT. Perhaps, when it comes to exploring something that is commonly misunderstood or misused, then could be better for us to start with first, defining what that 'something' isn't by using some examples of the common misuses or misconceptions. After all, we're probably more likely to understand and resonate with something that we already recognise.

_It is far from easy, and there is a great deal of mind-trickery that tells us we are collaborating when in fact we are coercing, manipulating, managing, shaping, colluding, controlling, seeking compliance and perhaps even sulking to get our own way. True collaboration is a rare bird of paradise, seldom seen, and when discovered often shot._'- **Tobias Mayer**

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Starting my Scrum Master journey from being a Project Manager in software development and a Paratrooper before that, I have had to adjust quite a bit in terms of my mindset and what I thought the characteristics of a good facilitator was. So in the journey of me transitioning, I have been subject to some, if not most of these examples at one point or another- a few examples from my perspective as a Scrum Master, of what I think facilitation is NOT.

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Typing and updating Product Backlog Items for the team in JIRA, Pivotal Tracker, or any other kind of software during Sprint Planning.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Solely about facilitating at the team level, but also the Product Owner and those at the wider Organisation level.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Telling a Scrum team what tools, techniques, methodologies and practices they should be using (suggestions for a team new to Scrum is fine).
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Being the one standing at the front and demonstrating the completed work during a Sprint Review.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Creating a list of actions for a Scrum team based on your own interpretation of collected data from a Sprint during a Retrospective.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Preaching about what it says in 'The Scrum Guide'.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Assigning tasks to members of the Scrum team.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Being known as the note taker for the Scrum team.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Solely chit chatting about the teams feelings during a Retrospective.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Running Daily Scrums as if there were report meeting.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Telling the Scrum team what their plan should be for improving.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">The '_Scrum Master facilitation is NOT preaching about what it says in 'The Scrum Guide_', I'd actually go as far in saying that I'd avoid dropping the words 'The Scrum Guide' or even 'Agile', from most interactions at work. Particularly when you're trying to get a point across or explain something. That goes for the Scrum team, Product Owner or someone within the organisation. In my experience, nothing falls quicker on deaf ears than a preaching Scrum Master reciting words from a 19-page guide book. Instead, I'd recommend using a real life examples, some kind of story, a form of metaphor or analogy.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What I find interesting about the _Scrum Master facilitation is NOT solely about facilitating at the team level, but also the Product Owner and those at the wider Organisation level_', is that there are many circumstances whereby, as a Scrum Master you may choose to experiment and facilitate in a slightly different way (not just in the Scrum events), perhaps to incorporate a new or different activity or method to help reach the desired outcome. Nothing wrong in getting feedback from the team on this either, I mean, it's good to model experimentation in your own efforts to become better in your role, isn't that what you'd expect from a team too? Scrum Masters are also be asked sometimes to help facilitate something for the organisation, which could entail considerations such as:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What are the desired outcomes?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Who will be attending (C-Levels, Stakeholders, Investors)?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Will any attendees be attending remotely?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What are the attendees expectations?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Who needs to know the results of the outcome?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Where will it be held?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What is the expected duration?

# Neutral Position
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;"><span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Being a good facilitator is the bread and butter for any Scrum Master, part of the role is to service the Product Owner and Development Team by '_Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed_'. Which sounds straight forward and in theory it is, the outcomes from each of Scrum event in the Scrum Guide are clear.
But I find interesting about the '_Scrum Master facilitation is NOT solely about facilitating at the team level, but also the Product Owner and those at the wider Organisation level_', is that there are many circumstances whereby, as a Scrum Master you may choose to experiment and facilitate in a slightly different way (not just in the Scrum events), perhaps to incorporate a new or different activity or method to help reach the desired outcome. Nothing wrong in getting feedback from the team on this either, I mean, it's good to model experimentation in your own efforts to become better in your role, isn't that what you'd expect from a team too? Scrum Masters are also be asked sometimes to help facilitate something for the organisation, which could entail considerations such as:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What are the desired outcomes?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Who will be attending (C-Levels, Stakeholders, Investors)?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Will any attendees be attending remotely?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What are the attendees expectations?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Who needs to know the results of the outcome?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Where will it be held?
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What is the expected duration?

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">What I think should Scrum Master facilitation SHOULD be about:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Ice breaking activities for new teams or members.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Integrating multiple frames of references.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Nurturing relationships between team members, Product Owner and in others within the organisation.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Guiding structured discussions about product and processes.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Assisting the team in divergent and convergent thinking.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Aiding with conflict resolution.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Group decision-making.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Internal and external collaboration meetings.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Integrating Scrum into the organisation.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">For me, facilitating as a Scrum Master is about staying in a neutral position, understanding the desired outcome of each event and have ability to keep things on track and encourage conversations to flow, but without letting things deviate too much from the desired outcome.

# Facilitating Scrum events
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">For some great examples of the type of characteristics that each Scrum event should have, I like what '_**Barry Overeem**_' offers in his post [The Scrum Master As A Facilitator](http://www.barryovereem.com/the-scrum-master-as-a-facilitator/). He describes the characteristics of well-facilitated Scrum events:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**The Daily Scrum** contains an atmosphere where healthy peer pressure occurs on delivery quality, commitment and addressing impediments;

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**The Sprint Planning** is all about collaboration between the Product Owner and the Development team and has a strong focus on delivering business value. All team members understand the work and jointly agree to achieve the sprint goal;

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**The Sprint Review** is an energising event in which the Scrum team, sponsors and stakeholders together inspect the product increment and backlog. But also retrospect their collaboration and how this can be improved. They act as one team with the same purpose, there are no barriers between ‘client’ and ‘supplier’;

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**The Retrospective** is done in a safe atmosphere in which ‘the elephant in the room’ is addressed, discussed and turned into actionable improvements that the team members agree upon realising in the next sprint.

# Psychological Environment
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Coming to what isn't always obvious, the types of obstacles (impediments) that prevent communication from working effectively and how facilitation can help- one of the main challenges is often the environment from a psychological perspective, it has to be psychologically safe. Not just that, if the culture of the organisation suffers from dysfunctions that diminish the levels of trust and respect needed for truthful conversation, then it is also likely that part of this will trickle down into the team layer level and could even be embedded within a Scrum team. If that's the case, then team members might not want to risk communicating what they really think. I mean, who wants to suggest an idea and get laughed at, or not be taken seriously? Is it easier for team members too just to succumb to the HIPPO (highest paid persons opinion) in the room, or conform to the most dominate member of the team for the sake of ease and conflict avoidance?

_'Positive emotions like trust, curiosity, confidence, and inspiration broaden the mind and help us build psychological, social, and physical resources. We become more open-minded, resilient, motivated, and persistent when we feel safe. Humour increases, as does solution-finding and divergent thinking — the cognitive process underlying creativity_'.- **Barbara L. Fredrickson**

# Physical Environment
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Another impediment that could be preventing effective communication might be physically related, for example, air conditioning of the rooms, room size, external noises and interferences. Having distributed team members may work well for some teams, other teams may find this difficult due to time zone differences, lag time between responses, loss of information that usually gets subtly conveyed when speaking with someone face to face.

# Biases & Negative Attitudes
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Other impediments might be found more in the context of conversations, for example, the surfacing of preconceived notions, negative attitudes and biases can all make communication difficult. I often play a game in my head called '_Spot the biases_'. It basically consists of me just being more attentive to judgements based on a personal points of view (including my own). I observe and listen out for biases in conversations and in the decisions that are being made. To do this has meant that I have to constantly had to remind myself, to be quiet and listen more, sometimes resist in breaking silence (usually at the very point at which I want to speak up or intervene). For anyone who has ever met me, will know, that this is an achievement of itself. Here are a few biases that I typically come across or have otherwise just found interesting:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Status quo bias** The tendency to like things to stay relatively the same.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Empathy gap** The tendency to underestimate the influence or strength of feelings, in either oneself or others.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Confirmation bias** The tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**IKEA effect** The tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end result.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Irrational escalation** The tendency to refer to a situation in which people can make irrational decisions based upon rational decisions in the past or to justify actions already taken.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Dunning–Kruger effect** The tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability and the tendency for experts to underestimate their own ability.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Focusing effect** The tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Framing effect** The tendency to react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Social desirability** The tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favourably by others.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Courtesy bias** The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, to avoid offending anyone.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Knowledge bias** The tendency to unknowingly assume that the others have the background to understand.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Illusion of control** The tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over other external events.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Planning fallacy** The tendency to underestimate task-completion times.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Not to worry too much about biases. I mean, we all have them at times and the science on this is clear- if you’re a human, then your brain operates through biases.

# Team Dysfunctions
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;"><span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">By being that somebody (the facilitator) that's in a neutral position, you're in a far better position to be able to; observe the behaviours and interactions of the team, notice how each member communicates and whether they're actually collaborating. Working on identifying and rectifying team dysfunctions based on **Patrick Lencioni's** - [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni/dp/0787960756), if you're not already doing so, it's a good place to start:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Absence of Trust**
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Fear of Conflict**
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Lack of Commitment**
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Avoidance of Accountability**
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">**Inattention to Results**

# 言語の問題 (Language Difficulties)
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">There can be impediments associated with languages difficulties, regional dialects or proficiency in a certain language. Using jargon or slang words can be confusing for some people due to generation gaps. Not having enough common experiences can also limit somebody's understanding of a discussion, if there are lot of stories or examples that are frequently being used to convey information.

# Conclusion
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Being able to work as a team successfully will often come down to how well individuals on that team respond to the methods that the team are using to work together- these methods ideally should be reviewed and evaluated by the team regularly. To avoid biases and encourage engagement from everyone on the team to make group decisions, having someone in neutral position to effectively facilitate this, helps ensure a smooth process and generally a much better outcome.

These basic ground rules can act as a modelling tool to exhibit desired group behaviour, they can also help with knowing when to intervene as a facilitator, as you're able to identify negative behaviours and general unhelpful group behaviour within the team- examples of some basic ground rules include:

- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Test assumptions and Inferences.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Keeps things transparent.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Be specific.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Explain reasoning and intent.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Focus on the interests rather than positions (solutions).
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Combining advocacy and inquiry.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Decisions should be made by the team.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Agree to address (if necessary) any uncomfortable issues.
- <span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Always strive to improve your facilitation skills.

<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Get feedback from your facilitation, why not? Much like how a good agile team operates through the transparency of their work, inspecting their users feedback, their product and processes regularly and then adapting to make improvements overtime.
