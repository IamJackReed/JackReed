Despite having a contingency plan there are still so many ways in which a sprint, or in fact an entire project can fail. In many cases knowing what to do given a certain situation will usually keep things under control. However, since contingency plans are only ever based on our knowledge that we have at the time, then occasionally problems will occur.

Agile has a strong emphasis on continuous improvement, focusing on enhancing the ability to work more efficiently and effectively to deliver business value early. It is therefore important to regularly review and evaluate the situation, the best time for this tends to be after delivering a slice of work (shippable software), since at that point feedback can be given to the team. This information along with other data gathered from the team in terms of how they have been working, can all feed into a sprint retrospective. To help avoid getting into some unnecessary bad situations, here are just a few important factors that you might want to consider during your next retrospective:


### Better Questions
Progress usually starts with asking questions, questions that lead to a better understanding: '_What Went Well in the Last Sprint?_', '_Was the expected work completed, if not why?_' or if it was a failed sprint the team might be keen to ask '_How did this happen?_', '_How can we stop this from happening again?_', '_How can we improve?_'. All these types of questions play a key part in convincing ourselves, and others to consider change. Being genuinely interested and listening to others when they respond to a question shows mutual respect, and can help towards creating a safe environment for conversation, as a result answers and suggestions are likely to continue to be contributed. Teams can often be biased on how they feel a sprint went based on how it ended, as result when asked '_What went well?_', they're tempted to say 'well, not much'. To avoid this, what I've found works well is having a board with the titles: '_What is going well?_' and '_What is not going well?_'. Leaving room underneath each title to allow team members to add things during the sprint, as opposed to asking the questions at the end of a sprint when people can often forget.

I'd also be mindful of the fact that sometimes when it comes to generating insights and ideas for change, people can often hold back because of their assumptions. Some classic examples of this can be when someone works within a big organisation, and they assume that because they are just one of many other employees, then their ideas and opinions won't make a difference. Another example could be when someone assumes that if an idea of theirs is considered a bad one, then they might get laughed at. And sometimes people hold back on putting forward an idea, simply because they assume that they'll just be creating additional work effort for themselves, and will be made responsible of making that idea work. All of the above examples probably go unnoticed more so in larger organisations, especially when there can be a lot of employees that have been there for a long time. They may of course be those employees that want to just show up at work, do their job (or at least what they are used to doing), get paid, then go home. In a scrum team, due to the nature of the team working so cohesively, constantly inspecting and adapting the way they work to improve. It is therefore critical that all the team members have a positive attitude, and feel empowered to contribute towards ideas for change without any negative assumptions, it should be in their vested interest to succeed, since they all share the responsibility for improvement.


### Avoid 'Dumb' Incentives
Setting commitments and reviewing previous commitments are often overlooked, but are an important aspect of the retrospective. When we set commitments that are exciting to us and we believe that it's attainable, then it can become extremely motivating for us to want to take action towards that desired commitment. However, I not think it is ever a good idea to attempt to incentivise members of an agile team by way of offering financial reward, or any reward in fact, just for carrying out what is expected from them in terms of their job duties, because this overtime will contribute in towards them only producing what is needed in order to obtain that reward. If incentives of any kind are to be rewarded, then I think they should be based on the successful achievements of the team or organisation, and not the individual.

###  Rules & Procedures
Rules and procedures help us, they help us because they stop us from having to think. Providing the rules are stuck to, and the procedures are followed then a fairly consistent output can be expected, and this decreases the risk of a disaster from happening. They also contribute towards shaping the culture of an organisation. On occasion rules and procedures need to be evaluated, some rules may be in place due to legislation. Have you ever questioned why something is done within an organisation a particular way because you don't fully understand why it is done that way, only to get a response like '_I'm not entirely sure, we've just always done it that way_'. When facing a challenge like changing something that has always been done a certain way, it may pay off to check whether it is an actually required, does it need to be performed as it is, or can there be room for negotiating a better solution?


### Conclusion
Fixing problems tend to come down to asking the right questions, evaluating and ensuring that sensible rules and procedures are in place, followed by incentives that we need in order to motivate us and others to change.
