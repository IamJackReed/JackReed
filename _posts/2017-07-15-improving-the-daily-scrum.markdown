<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Software development can be tricky, agile frameworks are often utilised to help make the whole delivery process easier. However, even when using one of the most popular lightweight frameworks such as Scrum, despite it's simplicity, it can still present it's fair share of challenges- let's jump straight in and I'll give you some examples:</span>

# Stuck in the Command Centre
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Having a team that doesn't want to stand up for the daily Scrum, isn't a major issue. In fact, it might even work well for some teams? However, I think in most cases twhen team members so stand for the daily Scrum, it often helps keep discussions brief and the team focused purely on the event itself. Whenever I've seen Scrum not working very well, the issues are often subtle. The root causes typically comes down to us, the people, our behaviour and our understanding of scrum. 
  
I try to highlight the key benefits of Scrum and how the Scrum events compliment each other. I believe, that setting up or resetting their Scrum mindset, plays a key part of the successful adoption of Scrum. It some cases, it may help to illustrate the associated risks and impacts that may occur as a result of not implementing the Scrum events - the real aim here is to get the PO, Scrum team and organisation to really understand the WHY.</span>


# Training Olympic Athletes
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Does your scrum team have members that like to use a stopwatch during the daily Scrum? If so, can I ask why? Please tell me that it's not being used to time each team member, giving them each an allocated time of x mins to complete their update? I hope not! I'd say that being mindful of the time, and keeping an eye on it is important, and it is certainly something that should be monitored in some way. However, if you are spending more than 2-3 minutes per team member when they are providing their updates, then perhaps there is an opportunity there for the team to learn more about the purpose of the daily scrum, and how it should be adopted. Not allowing a team member to finish their sentence just because they exceed a set time limit threshold by a matter of seconds, I think, is a little too strict and an unnecessary control. It shouldn't be so much about the time, but more so about the content. It's not a race to get the daily Scrum finished as soon as possible. I mean, despite it being a key part of a SPRINT it's not exactly what the name suggests. How are you supposed to have an environment that allows free flow of dialogue amongst the team, if those team members are being cut off mid sentence? STOPWATCH you're doing, don't race the pace, encourage conversation if it's relative and stick to what's happening in the next 24 hours, then time shouldn't be an issue.</span>


# Scrum Soldiers
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">Have you ever heard suggestions to help keep the daily Scrum brief that sound like this "_All team members should stand up on one leg for the entire daily Scrum"? Or worse, "_Hey, let's all get into a planking position for that daily Scrum". Who's coming up with these ideas? Neuroscience may have proven that engaging in a physical exercise regime helps improve your memory, brain health and physical fitness, etc. That may well be true, in my view and experience, physical exercise regimes deserve their own time and attention, if you want them to work successfully and shouldn't be something that you try to incorporate into your daily Scrum. I also believe, that every degree that your physical demand increases, then the chances are that your mental ability is likely to decrease.</span>


# Using a Marker Pen
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">This is actually an idea I'd recommend as I found it works well. I'll admit when it was first suggested, I was slightly hesitant. The idea sounded a bit like we were going to start documenting meeting notes for the daily Scrum. However, for this you'll need a board to write on and a marker pen. Whoever has the marker pen provides the team with their update, scribbling down perhaps just a subject heading of their update. When they're finished with their update, they simply pass the marker to another team member in a clockwise motion until everyone in the team are finished. As the marker pen is rotated amongst the team, I've found that it can help avoid that common issue amongst new scrum teams, whereby they look at the Scrum Master to decide who should speak next? Also, if the team updates are left on the board, then the next day it can act as a gentle reminder to everyone which saves having to remember what everyone said the day before, making it easier to pick up where you left off.</span>

# Conclusion
<span style="color:#00000; font-family: 'open sans'; font-size: 1em; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; hyphens: none;">If there is at least one shared purpose of a Scrum team that I think everyone can agree on, it is that they should always try to improve the way they work. Participating and trying to accomplish that equally shared purpose of finding out what really works best. There is always room for improvements and I believe that this is something that everyone in the scrum team should be responsible for - don't be put off from trying new innovative ways to improve and don't be discouraged to take action. Remember the challenge should be to find out what works best for the team whilst aiming to actually do something that can make a positive, significant and sustainable difference.</span>

That pretty much sums it up. Do you agree with any of it? Do you have any of your own tips/experiences with improving the daily Scrum? Let me know in the comments below.</span>
